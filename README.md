# EventsApp

This is the first project i did, following the step by step of this spring boot tutorial. After a long time without touching it I decided to add some more knowledge that I acquired like the docker, docker-compose and bootstrap. I intend to continue to learn more technologies and as I learn I intend to continue applying this project, as it is a simple project that I know well. Always keeping the project running.
